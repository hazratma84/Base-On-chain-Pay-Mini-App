# Base On-Chain Pay Mini App

Minimal Next.js + Tailwind sample app demonstrating on-chain ETH payments on Base L2.

Features:
- Connect to injected wallet (MetaMask / Coinbase)
- ENS resolution for recipients
- EIP-1559 fee suggestion
- Basic input validation and balance display

Run locally:
1. Install: `npm install`
2. Dev: `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`

Notes:
- This is a client-side wallet app â€” no server required for the sample.
- For production, add thorough error handling, gas management, and security reviews.
```
